# üçú Bite Track ü•ó

Monorepo based on `turborepo` used to build a small app for voice controlled nutrition tracking, mostly for fun and because it sounds useful to me.

This is a work in progress, and I'm building it as I go. I'm using this project as a playground for anything I want to practice.

The `/docs` folder contains some notes and ideas I have for future articles, detailing the process of building this app.

## What's inside?

This monorepo includes the following packages and apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `api`: an NestJS API server, based on hexagonal architecture
- `@bite-track/api-client`: a client library for the API, generated using `OpenAPI`, `@nestjs/swagger`, `turborepo` and `@hey-api/openapi-ts`.
- `@bite-track/eslint-config`: ESLint configurations used throughout the monorepo
- `@bite-track/typescript-config`: tsconfig.json's used throughout the monorepo
- `@bite-track/types`: shared types used throughout the monorepo

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This monorepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
